# Welcome to my portfolio!

Here you'll find some of the projects that I've been creating for my clients. My portfolio will increase continouslly as I negociate the liberation of my clients' proprietary code.

If you have any questions fell free to open a new issue.

* The **['pdf_manipulator'](https://github.com/andrehosantos/portfolio/pdf_manipulator)** project was designed to create and manipulate thousands of Postscript (PS) and PDF files. The program does the following:
  * Modify a base file content, specifically on lines containing certain string.
  * Save the modified content to a new PS file and converts it to a PDF file using the ['ps2pdf'](https://web.mit.edu/ghostscript/www/Ps2pdf.htm) package.
  * Join multiple PDF file into one file, and prepares each PDF collection to printing using the ['pdfjam'](https://github.com/rrthomas/pdfjam) package.
  * The prepared PDF collections are imported into CorelDraw using a VBA script, and automatically send to printing.
