## ['pdf_manipulator'](https://github.com/andrehosantos/portfolio/pdf_manipulator) Project

The 'pdf_manipulator' project is a powerful tool designed to create and manipulate thousands of Postscript (PS) and PDF files. It offers the following features:

1. **Modification of base file content:** The program can efficiently modify specific lines in a file that contain a certain string. This allows for targeted content customization.

2. **Saving modified content:** After the necessary modifications, the program saves the modified content to a new PS file. It then utilizes the ['ps2pdf'](https://web.mit.edu/ghostscript/www/Ps2pdf.htm) package to convert the PS file to a PDF file. This conversion ensures compatibility and wider usability.

3. **PDF file merging:** 'pdf_manipulator' provides the ability to join multiple PDF files into a single file. This feature allows for convenient management and organization of related PDF documents.

4. **Printing preparation:** To optimize the printing process, the program utilizes the ['ps2pdf'](https://web.mit.edu/ghostscript/www/Ps2pdf.htm) package to prepare each PDF collection for printing. It applies formatting and layout adjustments, such as arranging pages in a 1x2 grid, setting the paper size to {213mm,297mm}, and configuring landscape orientation. This ensures that the final printed output meets the desired specifications.

Furthermore, the prepared PDF collections can be seamlessly imported into CorelDraw using a VBA script. This integration simplifies the workflow and enables smooth transitioning to the printing stage.

I take pride in delivering efficient and effective solutions to my clients, and I am committed to continuously enhancing my skills and expanding my portfolio.

If you have any inquiries or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to working with you.
